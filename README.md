# Practical Text Classification With Python 

## Description 

Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.

Using reviews from Amazon, IMPD and Yelp as the data set, we are able to train a model to predict the sentiment of a sentence. 

The way to do this is to count the frequency of each word in each sentence and tie this count back to the entire set of words in the data set. You would start by taking the data and creating a vocabulary from all the words in all sentences. The collection of texts is also called a corpus in NLP.
